&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What drew you to this play? What did you want to do with it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Coleman, the Artistic Director of Portland Center Stage, sent me Dan’s play and I was completely riveted.  I was equally moved by the story and challenged by the unconventional way of telling it.  I remember when I first read it thinking: “I have no idea how I would stage this play.”  That made me realize that I should say yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is it like to work with a cast as small as that of &lt;/em&gt;The Body of an American&lt;em&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Body&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of an American&lt;/i&gt; has only two actors.  That meant  an intimate and deep dive with two remarkable artists.  We tended to work only 6 hours a day, without a meal break, as opposed to the 8 hours plus a meal break that I would use to rehearse a larger cast.  The level of trust required in the room was all the more intense because the focus was always on the same two performers. We created real trust between director and actors, playwright and actors, and between the two actors themselves.  It was a powerful experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What kind of research did you do to prepare for directing &lt;/em&gt;The Body of an American&lt;em&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important source for me in preparing was the playwright Dan O’Brien. Dan flew to Ashland where we were able to spend several hours together working through the script.  Because the play is partly autobiographical, I was especially fascinated to learn more about his side of the story.  I got to know Paul Watson, and his remarkable work, through interviews and of course his book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How would you describe the roles you and O&#039;Brien played in the production of &lt;/em&gt;The Body of an American&lt;em&gt;, as director and playwright? What did that dynamic look like?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan O’Brien was with us for most of the rehearsal process.  The collaboration between playwright, director, and actors was very fluid and open-ended.  Dan has fantastic ideas and we made many discoveries together.  As with many successful artistic processes, it would be hard to reconstruct who had what idea when.  That is a sign of a healthy and happy process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How did you go about determining set and stage directions? How much did you draw from written directions in the script? Did you have a vision for all of these, or did you rely on the scenic/set designer for this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script includes suggestions of projections but little else in the way of stage directions.  In fact, the sparseness of the script is part of what challenged and excited me as a director.  Set and costume designer Christopher Acebo and I knew that we needed to keep the focus on the two actors and their ability to transform.  We knew that we wanted our design gestures to be few and powerful, but we also knew that design could be an incredible ally in communicating context for the audience.  It was a fun puzzle to solve. Projection and sound designer Eamonn Farrell expanded on Dan’s scripted suggestions for projection and sound imagery in ways that were quite liberating.  Through out tech and preview process, we tried many ideas that we reshaped and sometimes cut altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What led you to becoming a director? Where did you start, and how did you get here?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be an actor as a child.  And I acted in as many plays as I could from elementary school to my first semester at college.  In my second semester, I directed my first full-length play and it hit me with incredible clarity that I had found my life’s work.  With many of my dearest college friends I co-founded a community-based theater that traveled the country.  We worked with residents of both rural and urban communities, often first-time actors, to create adaptations of classic plays as well as new works.  Cornerstone Theater Company continues to thrive in Los Angeles, 28 years after its founding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cornerstone was invited to create community collaborative projects with some of our country’s largest regional theaters and those projects, in turn, led me to direct in some of those theaters on my own as a freelance artist.  When I first directed at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, I sensed that I had found a new artistic home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&#039;s on your plate next? What is exciting to you right now, about your projects or in the theater world in general?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m extremely excited to be directing the sequel to &lt;i&gt;All the Way&lt;/i&gt;, Robert Schenkkan’s &lt;i&gt;Great Society&lt;/i&gt; in Ashland, opening in July 2014.  Many of the cast members of the original production will be reprising their roles and our audiences seem to be as giddy with anticipation as I am.  I hope to be lucky enough to work with Dan O’Brien again in the future as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m one of the lucky ones.  I get to live my dreams everyday.&lt;/p&gt;
